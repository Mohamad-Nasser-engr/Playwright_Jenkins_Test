# üìò Playwright with Java & JUnit ‚Äì Research Findings

## üß© Overview

This document summarizes my research on using [Microsoft Playwright](https://playwright.dev/java/) for end-to-end testing with **Java** and **JUnit**. It focuses on how Playwright can facilitate rapid test creation via its **codegen recorder**, and how it fits into modern DevOps pipelines.

---

## üîß Prerequisites
- Java 
- Node.js installed (for Playwright CLI tools)
- Maven installed
- Jenkins server set up
- JIRA Cloud account with admin access

---

## üöÄ Why Playwright?

Playwright is an open-source test automation framework by Microsoft that supports:
- Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Headless & headed execution
- Native support for multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, C#)
- Auto-wait and smart assertions
- **Recorder tool to auto-generate tests**

---

## üß™ Technology Stack

- **Playwright** v1.51.0 
- **Java** 
- **JUnit 5**
- **Maven** (for project and dependency management)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Add Playwright and Junit 5 to your Maven `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.microsoft.playwright</groupId>
  <artifactId>playwright</artifactId>
  <version>1.51.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
  <version>5.8.1</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit-jupiter-engine</artifactId>
  <version>5.8.1</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
### 2. Install Playwright recorder
This step installs Playwright using the Node.js version, which is required to record and generate Java test code.
```bash
npx playwright install 
```
### 3. Use Playwright's recorder 
This will generate Java + JUnit code you can paste into your test classes.
```bash
npx playwright codegen https://example.com
```

## Integration with Jenkins 
To integrate your Playwright tests with Jenkins, follow these steps to set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline that automatically runs your tests.
### 1. Install Jenkins
### 2. Install Required Plugins
Ensure the following plugins are installed (Manage Jenkins ‚Üí Manage Plugins):
- Git Plugin ‚Äì For Git integration
- GitHub Plugin ‚Äì For GitHub webhooks and integration
- JUnit ‚Äì To publish test results
- Maven Integration ‚Äì To build Maven projects
### 3. Create and configure a new Maven Project:
- In Jenkins, click New Item, name your job, and select Maven Project.
- Under Source Code Management, select Git and enter your GitHub repository URL.
- In the Build section:

  Root POM:
  ```
  pom.xml
  ```
  Goals and Options:
  ```
  clean install
  ```
  This runs your tests based on the pom.xml configuration.
  ### Note on ***pom.xml*** for Jenkins Compatibility:
  To ensure Jenkins can execute your Playwright tests via Maven:
  - The project defines maven-surefire-plugin, which runs JUnit 5 tests during the test phase:
    ```xml
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.0.0-M5</version>
      <configuration>
      ...
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
    ```
  - The junit-jupiter-api and junit-jupiter-engine dependencies are declared with <scope>test</scope>, so tests can be discovered and run correctly.
  - Ensure your test classes follow the naming convention ***Test.java** so Surefire can detect them. If not, update includes in the plugin config.

## Jenkins Integration with JIRA
Integrating Jenkins with JIRA allows automatic linking of build results, commits, and issues, making it easier to track development progress directly from JIRA.
### Steps to integrate Jenkins with JIRA
### 1. Install the Jenkins JIRA Plugin
- Go to Manage Jenkins ‚Üí Manage Plugins
- Under the Available tab, search for and install JIRA Plugin
- Restart Jenkins if prompted
### 2. Create a JIRA API Token (for Atlassian Cloud users)
If you're using Atlassian Cloud, you need an API token to authenticate Jenkins.
To generate one:
- Visit https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens
- Click Create API token
- Enter a label like "Jenkins Integration", then click Create
- Copy the generated token (you won‚Äôt be able to view it again)
- In Jenkins:
   - Go to Manage Jenkins ‚Üí Credentials
   - Click **Add Credentials**
     - **Kind**: Username with password
     - **Username**: Your Atlassian account email
     - **Password**: Paste the API token
     - **ID/Description**: Optional (e.g., jira-api-token)
### 3. Configure JIRA site in Jenkins
- Go to Manage Jenkins ‚Üí Configure System
- Scroll to the JIRA section
- Click Add Jira Site
    - Enter the JIRA server URL (e.g., https://yourcompany.atlassian.net)
    - Add the previously created credentials (JIRA API token)
    - Test the connection
### 4. Link JIRA site in a Jenkins Job
- Open your Jenkins Job ‚Üí Configure
- Scroll to the JIRA site section
- Select the JIRA site you previously configured

## Xray Integration for Test Management:
Xray is a powerful test management tool for Jira that allows teams to manage automated and manual tests directly from within Jira. We integrate Xray with Jenkins to automatically import test execution results, enabling traceability between test runs and Jira issues.
Using Xray ensures full visibility into testing status within Jira

Pricing: Xray for Jira Cloud is a paid add-on, with pricing starting at $10/month for up to 10 users. Larger teams incur additional costs.

### 1. Install the Xray App in JIRA:
- In Jira, go to Apps ‚Üí Explore more apps
- Search for Xray Test Management for Jira
- Click Install
- Once installed, it will appear in the Apps section
### 2. Install the Xray Plugin in Jenkins
- Navigate to Jenkins Dashboard ‚Üí Manage Jenkins ‚Üí Plugins.
- Search for Xray and install the plugin.
- Restart Jenkins if required.
### 3. Create API Credentials in Jira:
- In Jira, go to Apps ‚Üí Manage Apps ‚Üí API Keys.
- Click Create API Key.
- Give it a name, and copy the generated key for later use.
### 4. Configure Xray in Jenkins:
- Go to Manage Jenkins ‚Üí System ‚Üí Configure System.
- Scroll to the Xray Configuration section.
- Fill in the following:
  - Configuration Alias: Choose JIRA Cloud.
  - Hosting Type: Select Cloud.
  - Credentials: Add the API Key from Step 2 as a new credential.
- Click Test Connection to ensure everything works correctly.
### 5. Add Xray Reporting in a Jenkins Job:
- Open your Jenkins job and click Configure.
- Under Post-build Actions, click Add post-build action ‚Üí Select Xray: Results Import Task.
- Set the following options:
  - Instance: Choose JIRA Cloud.
  - Format: Choose JUnit XML.
  - Execution Report File: Enter your test report path (e.g., target/surefire-reports/*.xml).
  - JIRA Project Key: Enter the Jira project key (e.g., ABC).
  - Test Execution Key: Enter the corresponding Test Execution issue key (e.g., ABC-123).
